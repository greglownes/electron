    <h1>Form and Communications</h1>
    This form is built with plain HTML and CSS.<br>
    The form submit event is captured in the renderer process's javascript where it can be
    used directly or passed back to the main process using ipcRenderer.send().<br>
    In the case of this demo it is passed back to the main process, which simply echo's it
    to the terminal window as proof that it worked.<br>
    <form action="#" id="ipcForm2">

        <input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname" value="John">
        <br>
        Last name:<br>
        <input type="text" name="lastname" id="lastname" value="Smith">
        <br><br>
        <input id="submit" type="submit" value="Submit">
