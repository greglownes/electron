    <h1>Menu</h1>
    The Demo menu at the top left simply replicates the left nav links.<br>
    <br>
    Custom menus are easy to create using menu templates.<br>
    However, unlike most electron functionality, there are platform differences<br>
    that need to be considered between Mac, Win and Linux.<br>
    <br>
    Another tricky part is communications between the menu in the main process<br>
    down to the pages in the renderer process.<br>
    The Demo menu item uses webContents() to send events to the index.html renderer,<br>
    which in turn activates the appropriate page/content.
